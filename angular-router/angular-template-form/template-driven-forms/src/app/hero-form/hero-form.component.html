<!-- To get access to the NgForm and the overall form status,
  declare a template reference variable  #heroForm="ngForm" -->

<!-- When you use [(ngModel)] on an element, you must define a name attribute for that element.
  Angular uses the assigned name to register the element with the NgForm directive
  attached to the parent <form> element.

  The example added a name attribute to the <input> element and set it to "name",
  which makes sense for the hero's name. Any unique value will do,
  but using a descriptive name is helpful. -->

<!-- Notice that each <input> element has an id property.
  This is used by the <label> element's for attribute to match the label to its input control.
    This is a standard HTML feature. -->

<!-- Each <input> element also has the required name property that Angular
  uses to register the control with the form. -->

<!-- Angular through the NgModel directive sets special CSS classes
  on the control element to reflect the state
      form-control
     ng-touched (True)	ng-untouched (False)
     ng-dirty (True)	ng-pristine (False)
     ng-valid (True)	ng-invalid (False)
-->

<!-- Track control states
  The control has been visited =>	ng-touched (True)	ng-untouched (False)
  The control's value has changed. => ng-dirty (True)	ng-pristine (False)
  The control's value is valid. => ng-valid (True)	ng-invalid (False)
 -->

          Pristine means the user hasn't changed the value since it was displayed in this form.
          If you ignore the pristine state, you would hide the message only when the value is valid.
          If you arrive in this component with a new (blank) hero or an invalid hero,
